------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have used some tools and with the help of them we have developed this system.
The tools are...
1.Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.
2.SQL Server management system 2014.
3.Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Installer Projects.(For Setup)

                                                             ##How SQL Works
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the Sql query txt file.Copy all the query
Open a SQL 
Then 1st Execute the "CREATE DATABASE LOGIN_DB;"
Then select LOGIN_DB option at drop box beside Execute Button.
Then EXECUTE all the table create query one by one.

Then 1st Execute the "CREATE DATABASE CUSTOMER_DB;"
Then select CUSTOMER_DB option at drop box beside Execute Button.
Then EXECUTE all the table create query one by one.

Then 1st Execute the "CREATE DATABASE STUFF_DB;"
Then select STUFF_DB option at drop box beside Execute Button.

                                                          ##Connect to Visual studio

                                                              ##How it Works
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After opening a Log in page will be visible. From here admin and sell can login the system.

At first login as admin, Admin dashboard (staff, seller, tranasaction, add-slot, blockd-slot) will come up. Each page has its own functions.
After login as seller,  seller dashboard(Buy slot, My cart, Add Cow) will come up.  Each page has its own functions
If You are new as Customer then you need to input information, give input username and password.  For that Go to "Sign up as customer" at the lower part of Login page.
